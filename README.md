# Peeranoia_Framework 
One of the activities of most successful intruders of a computer system is to modify data on the victim, either to hide his/her presence and to destroy the evidence of the break-in, or to subvert the system completely and make it accessible for further abuse without triggering alarms. File integrity checking is one common method to mitigate the effects of successful intrusions by detecting the changes an intruder makes to files on a computer system. Historically file integrity checking has been implemented using tools that operate locally on a single system, which imposes quite some restrictions regarding maintenance and scalability. Recent improvements for large scale environments have introduced trusted central servers which provide secure fingerprint storage and logging facilities, but such centralism presents some new shortcomings. This thesis describes an alternative, decentralised approach where peer-to-peer mechanisms are used to provide fingerprint storage for file integrity checking with more flexibility and scalability than offered by currently available systems. A research implementation has been developed to verify the approach as viable and practical, and experimental results obtained with that prototype are discussed.

<h1>What the project does</h1>
Peeranoia_Framework is the peers, code and software of a network used to exchange, compare, and verify checksums. An association of those competant enough to check checksums. Here peer-to-peer mechanisms are used to provide checksum storage for file integrity checking with more flexibility and scalability than offered by currently available systems.

<h2>Why the project is useful</h2>
Checksums are useful for obvious reasons vandalism, forgery, and so forth. This project brings together competent peers so that PEERANOIA can be enacted.

<h3>How users can get started with the project</h3>
First read Zangler. If you can do a checksum then you qualify to join. To get started click join discussion. You need to be able to show competency and knowledge. Introduce yourself and contribute a relevent question or comment. To show that you have read Zangler. Then to show that uou are competent share any checksum.
